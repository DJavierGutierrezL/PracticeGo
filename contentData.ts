    title: 'The Lion and the Mouse',
    author: 'Aesop',
    text: `Once upon a time, a great lion was sleeping in the forest. His large head rested on his paws. A tiny, timid mouse unexpectedly ran across the lion's nose. The lion woke up with a loud roar. He was very angry. He quickly caught the little mouse in his huge paws. The lion opened his big jaws to swallow him. "Pardon, O King!" cried the little mouse. "Forgive me this time. I shall never repeat it and I shall never forget your kindness. Who knows, but I may be able to do you a good turn one of these days?" The lion was so amused by the idea of the mouse being able to help him that he lifted up his paw and let him go. Some weeks later, a hunter set a trap for the lion. The lion fell into the trap. He was caught in the ropes of a net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The mouse knew the voice and quickly found the lion struggling in the net. The mouse ran to one of the great ropes that bound him and gnawed it with his teeth until it parted. Soon, the lion was free. "You laughed when I said I would repay you," said the mouse. "Now you see that even a mouse can help a lion." A small act of kindness is never wasted.`,

    title: 'The Boy Who Cried Wolf',
    author: 'Aesop',
    text: `There was once a young shepherd boy who tended his sheep at the foot of a mountain near a dark forest. It was rather lonely for him all day, so he thought upon a plan by which he could get a little company and some excitement. He rushed down towards the village calling out "Wolf, Wolf," and the villagers came out to meet him, and some of them stopped with him for a consideration of time. This pleased the boy so much that a few days afterwards he tried the same trick, and again the villagers came to his help. But shortly after this a wolf actually did come out from the forest, and began to worry the sheep, and the boy of course cried out "Wolf, Wolf," still louder than before. But this time the villagers, who had been fooled twice before, thought the boy was again deceiving them, and nobody stirred to come to his help. So the wolf made a good meal off the boy's flock, and when the boy complained, the wise man of the village said: "A liar will not be believed, even when he speaks the truth."

    title: 'The Tortoise and the Hare',
    author: 'Aesop',
    text: `A Hare was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow. "Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh. "Yes," replied the Tortoise, "and I get there sooner than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it." The Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the Fox, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance and started the runners off. The Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Hare, he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up. The Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the Hare was sleeping. But the Hare slept on very peacefully; and when at last he did wake up, the Tortoise was near the goal. The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time. The lesson of this story is that slow and steady wins the race, reminding us that persistence is more important than speed.`,

    title: 'The Fox and the Grapes',
    author: 'Aesop',
    text: `One hot summer's day a Fox was strolling through an orchard till he came to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which had been trained over a lofty branch. "Just the thing to quench my thirst," he said. Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and a jump, and just missed the bunch. Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, he jumped up, but with no greater success. Again and again he tried after the tempting morsel, but at last had to give it up, and walked away with his nose in the air, saying: "I am sure they are sour." This story teaches us that it is easy to despise what you cannot get. When someone cannot achieve their goal, they often pretend it was not worth having in the first place. This is a common way to handle disappointment, but it is not an honest one. True strength is in accepting our limits and moving on without making excuses. It is better to admit failure than to pretend we never wanted to succeed.`,

    text: `In a field one summer's day a Grasshopper was hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart's content. An Ant passed by, bearing along with great effort an ear of corn he was taking to the nest. "Why not come and chat with me," said the Grasshopper, "instead of toiling and moiling in that way?" "I am helping to lay up food for the winter," said the Ant, "and recommend you to do the same." "Why bother about winter?" said the Grasshopper; "we have got plenty of food at present." But the Ant went on its way and continued its toil. When the winter came the Grasshopper had no food and found itself dying of hunger, while it saw the ants distributing every day corn and grain from the stores they had collected in the summer. Then the Grasshopper knew: "It is best to prepare for the days of necessity." This fable shows the importance of planning for the future and working hard today to ensure comfort tomorrow.

    text: `The North Wind and the Sun had a quarrel about which of them was the stronger. While they were disputing with much heat and bluster, a Traveler passed along the road wrapped in a cloak. "Let us agree," said the Sun, "that he is the stronger who can strip that Traveler of his cloak." "Very well," growled the North Wind, and at once sent a cold, howling blast against the Traveler. With the first gust of wind the ends of the cloak whipped about the Traveler's body. But he immediately wrapped it closely around him, and the harder the Wind blew, the tighter he held it to him. The North Wind tore angrily at the cloak, but all his efforts were in vain. Then the Sun began to shine. At first his beams were gentle, and in the pleasant warmth after the bitter cold of the North Wind, the Traveler unfastened his cloak and let it hang loosely from his shoulders. The Sun's rays grew warmer and warmer. The man took off his cap and mopped his brow. At last he became so heated that he pulled off his cloak, and, to escape the blazing sunshine, threw himself down in the welcome shade of a tree. The moral is that persuasion is better than force.`,

    author: 'Aesop',
    text: `Once upon a time, a man and his wife had the good fortune to have a goose which laid a golden egg every day. Lucky though they were, they soon began to think they were not getting rich fast enough. They imagined that if the goose could lay such a fine egg of gold, it must be made of gold inside. So they decided to kill the goose and get all the gold at once. But when they cut the goose open, they were shocked to find that its insides were like that of any other goose. There was no gold at all. And now they had lost the goose and the golden eggs she laid every day. So, they had no more golden eggs, and they were poor again. The couple had destroyed the source of their wealth because of their impatience and greed. This story teaches a valuable lesson about the dangers of wanting too much too soon. People who are greedy often end up with nothing. It is important to appreciate what you have and not risk it all for a chance at more.`,

    title: 'The Crow and the Pitcher',
    author: 'Aesop',
    text: `A thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in it. But the water was so low that the Crow could not reach it with his beak. He tried to break the pitcher, and then to overturn it, but it was too heavy and strong. At last, seeing some small pebbles nearby, he had an idea. He dropped a pebble into the pitcher. Then he dropped another pebble in. Then another. And another. With each pebble he dropped in, the water rose a little higher. At last the water was high enough for him to drink. And so, by patience and clever thinking, the Crow saved his life. This fable teaches us that we can solve difficult problems by thinking creatively and taking small, persistent steps. What we cannot accomplish by brute strength, we can often achieve through intelligence. The crow did not give up when faced with a challenge. Instead, he observed his surroundings and found a simple yet effective solution. This is a powerful reminder that necessity is the mother of invention.`,

The Town Mouse ate very sparingly, nibbling a little of this and a little of that, and by her manner made it very plain that she ate the simple food only to be polite. After the meal the friends had a long talk, or rather the Town Mouse talked about her life in the city while the Country Mouse listened. They then went to bed in a cozy nest in the hedgerow and slept in quiet and comfort until morning. In her sleep the Country Mouse dreamed she was a Town Mouse with all the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described. So the next day when the Town Mouse asked her to go home with him to the city, she gladly said yes. When they reached the mansion in which the Town Mouse lived, they found on the table in the dining room the richest food. But just as they were about to begin, the door of the room flew open and in came two huge dogs. The mice had to scamper down and run off. The Country Mouse decided to go back home, saying "You have luxuries and plenty to eat, but I prefer my simple food and my simple life in the country with the peace and security that go with it."`,

    text: `A Dog, to whom the butcher had thrown a bone, was hurrying home with his prize as fast as he could go. As he crossed a narrow footbridge, he happened to look down and saw himself reflected in the quiet water as if in a mirror. But the greedy Dog thought he saw a real Dog carrying a bone much bigger than his own. "I'll grab that bone too," he thought. So he greedily opened his mouth to snatch the other bone. But as he did so, his own bone fell into the water, and was lost forever in the stream. The dog was left with nothing. He had been so focused on getting more that he had lost the very thing he already possessed. This short story is a powerful warning against the dangers of greed. If you are not careful, in your desire for more, you might lose everything you have. It teaches us to be content with what we have and to not let envy or greed cloud our judgment.

    text: `Deep in a sunlit forest, there was a charming little cottage where a family of three bears lived: a great big Papa Bear, a middle-sized Mama Bear, and a wee little Baby Bear. One morning, Mama Bear made some delicious porridge for breakfast, but it was too hot to eat. So, the three bears decided to go for a walk while it cooled. Soon after they left, a curious little girl with golden hair named Goldilocks came upon the cottage. She knocked on the door, but no one answered. She peeked inside and, seeing no one, she stepped in. On the table, she saw three bowls of porridge. She tasted the porridge from Papa Bear's bowl, and it was too hot! She tasted Mama Bear's porridge, and it was too cold! Then she tasted Baby Bear's porridge, and it was just right, so she ate it all up. Feeling full, she looked for a place to sit. She tried Papa Bear's chair, but it was too hard. She tried Mama Bear's chair, but it was too soft. Then she tried Baby Bear's little chair, and it was just right! But as she sat down, the chair broke into pieces. Goldilocks then went upstairs and found three beds. Papa Bear's bed was too hard, Mama Bear's bed was too soft, but Baby Bear's bed was just right. She lay down and quickly fell fast asleep. Soon, the three bears returned from their walk, ready for breakfast. They immediately knew someone had been in their house. "Someone's been eating my porridge!" growled Papa Bear. "Someone's been sitting in my chair!" cried Baby Bear. Then they went upstairs. "Someone's been sleeping in my bed," growled Papa Bear. Then Baby Bear saw the little girl. "Someone's been sleeping in my bed, and here she is!" he squeaked. Just then, Goldilocks woke up. She saw the three bears staring at her, jumped out of bed, ran out of the house, and never returned to the forest again.`,

Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day. The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney. The next day, a big bad wolf came upon the first little pig. "Let me in, let me in, little pig or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!" he cried. The pig did not let him in, so the wolf blew down the straw house. The little pig ran to the second pig's house. The wolf came and blew down the stick house too. They both ran to the third pig's house made of bricks. The wolf huffed and puffed, but he could not blow down that house. The angry wolf decided to climb down the chimney.

Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood. One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother as it had been awhile since they'd seen each other. "That's a good idea," her mother said. So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother. When she was leaving, her mother told her to go straight to her grandmother's house. But when Little Red Riding Hood noticed some lovely flowers in the woods, she forgot her promise to her mother. She picked a few, watched the butterflies flit about for a while, listened to the frogs croaking and then picked a few more. A wolf, seeing her, wanted to eat her but dared not because of some woodcutters nearby. He approached her and asked where she was going. She told him. He then suggested she pick some flowers for her grandmother. As she was doing this, the wolf ran to her grandmother's house, pretended to be the girl, got in, and swallowed the grandmother whole. He then dressed in her clothes. When Little Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed her grandmother looked very strange. "Oh, what big eyes you have," she said. "The better to see you with," replied the wolf. "What big ears you have." "The better to hear you with." "What big teeth you have." "The better to eat you with!" he roared, and he ate her too. A woodsman heard the noise, came to the house, and saved them both from the wolf's belly.`,

    text: `Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her son Jack. One day, Jack’s mother told him to sell their only cow. Jack went to the market and on the way he met a man who wanted to buy his cow. Jack asked, "What will you give me in return for my cow?" The man answered, "I will give you five magic beans!" Jack took the beans and went back home. When Jack’s mother saw the beans she was very angry. She threw the beans out of the window. The next morning, Jack looked out of the window and saw that a huge beanstalk had grown. He went outside and started to climb the beanstalk. He climbed up to the sky through the clouds. Jack saw a beautiful castle. He went inside. Jack heard a voice. "Fee, fi, fo, fum!" Jack ran into a cupboard. An enormous giant came into the room and sat down. On the table there was a hen and a golden harp. The giant shouted, "Lay!" and the hen laid a golden egg. Then he shouted "Sing!" and the harp began to sing. Soon the giant fell asleep. Jack jumped out of the cupboard. He took the hen and the harp. Suddenly, the harp sang, "Help, master!" The giant woke up and saw Jack with the hen and the harp. Jack ran and started to climb down the beanstalk. The giant followed him. Jack shouted, "Mother, help!" Jack’s mother took an axe and chopped down the beanstalk. The giant fell and crashed to the ground. Nobody ever saw him again. With the golden eggs and the magic harp, Jack and his mother lived happily ever after.`,

"But remember," she warned, "you must leave the ball before midnight, for that is when the spell will break." At the ball, everyone was amazed by her beauty, especially the prince. He danced with her all night. As the clock struck twelve, Cinderella rushed away, leaving one of her glass slippers on the stairs. The prince was determined to find her.
